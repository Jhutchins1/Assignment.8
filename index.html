<p>This bar graph represents the change in population in the state of Florida over the past 12 years. As you can see, the population has slowly but surely increased over time up to 22 million people. Florida is now recorded as the 3rd most populated state in the United States behind California (1) and Texas (2). In 2011, the population was 19 million, meaning we have seen about a 3 million increase in the states population over the last decade or so.</p>

<p>This chart visualizes the distribution of different races as a proportion of Florida's entire population. In particular, this chart specifically represents the portion of Florida's population that is only a single race. This means that each figure represents people  identify with only a single race, such as only Asian, or only White, not a combination of two or more races. There are six categories on this chart, White, Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and Other. The American Indian/Alaska Native and the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander categories are just slivers compared to the rest of the chart, and you can see these categories by hovering your cursor over the labels to the left.</p>
