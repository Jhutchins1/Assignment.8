<p>Source: United States Census Bureau, <a href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=Florida+population+2012-2020">Decennial Census 2020, P1 | Race </a></p>

<p>This chart visualizes the distribution of different races as a proportion of Florida's entire population. In particular, this chart specifically represents the portion of Florida's population that is only a single race. This means that each figure represents people  identify with only a single race, such as only Asian, or only White, not a combination of two or more races. There are six categories on this chart, White, Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and Other. The American Indian/Alaska Native and the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander categories are just slivers compared to the rest of the chart, and you can see these categories by hovering your cursor over the labels to the left.</p>
